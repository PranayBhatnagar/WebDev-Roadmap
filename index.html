      <h2>Front-end Development</h2>
      <p>Firstly start things off with grasping the basic knwoledge about how the web works?, what are webpages and websites. Learn the buzzwords such as domain and servers. Next start with the most basic programming web language that is HTML(HyperText Markup Language). After HTML, go on with CSS(Cascading Style Sheets). HTML build the structure of the website and CSS is for styling the website. The next important step would be to learn Bootstrap or Tailwind. They help to create stunning websites. The last and final steps would be to learn JavaScript with React.js. This would help to create interactive websites.</p>

      <h3>Back-end Development</h3>
      <p>Back-end Development is also referred to as the server-side of the website. One can start server side development by the help of learning Node.js and Express.js. After this there is a simple roadmap where we have to start off by learning APIs(Application Programming Interfaces) and then moving on to EJS. To have a strong grip on the server side of the website one should learn Databases and SQL along with MongoDB and Mongoose. After learning both Front-end and Back-end development one should focus on domain such as Blockchain and DApps.</p>
